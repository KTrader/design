This is a quick document to describe the goals the trading platform product.

# Goals:
* Architecture a system from beginning to end
* Separate system into isolated components
* Demonstrate understanding of message buses
* Learn Kotlin regardless of whether or not it is an appropriate language for a trading system
* Deeper understanding of Kafka, Avro, and the Schema Registry
* Reactive / Streaming end to end
* A project with clearly defined boundaries so I can actually finish it and measure my progress.

# Non-Goals:
* Not targeting HFT. 
* Most technologies like Koltin, Kafka, Avro, are because I want to learn them, not because they are the best technology for the job.
* We are not focusing on profitable strategies, but the framework around them. A profitable strategy is an entire subject in itself.
